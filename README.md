Selling Point: Most budgeting apps ask you how much you’ll make this mont. But for hourly workers, that number isn’t always clear. That’s why I created WageWatch: a budgeting app built for hourly workers. Just clock in and out when you work, log expenses as they happen, and let the app do the rest. With wageWatch, you can see your real-time earnings, track expenses effortlessly, and always know how much you really have available
